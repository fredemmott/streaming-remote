# Installation

## OBS Studio

1. Download the OBS studio plugin and extract it
2. Copy the `.dll` or `.so` to the `obs-plugins` sub-folder of your OBS studio installation
   - If you use 64-bit OBS for Windows, this is likely `C:\Program Files\obs-studio\obs-plugins\64bit`
   - If you use 32-bit OBS for Windows, this is likely `C:\Program Files\obs-studio\obs-plugins\32bit`
   - If you use OBS for MacOS, this is likely `/Applications/OBS.app/Contents/PlugIns`
   - If you installed OBS using homebrew, will need to build from source
3. Start OBS
4. Configure the plugin from "Streaming Remote Settings" in the Tools menu

## StreamDeck plugin

1. Download and open the plugin
2. The StreamDeck software should automatically open the plugin and ask if you want to install
3. Enter the password and connection details; for example, if OBS is running on 'mypc' with WebSocket port
   9002, enter `ws://mypc:9002`. Be sure to use the WebSocket port, not the TCP port.

## XSplit Broadcaster

1. Download the XSplit plugin and extract it
2. Copy the `dll` to the `ScriptDlls\Local` subdirectory of your XSplit installation; this is likely
  `C:\Program Files (x86)\SplitmediaLabs\XSplit Broadcaster\x64\Scriptdlls\Local`
3. Select "Extensions" -> "Add extension" -> "Add extension file"
4. Use the "Browse" button to find the index.html file inside the plugin directory
5. Open "Tools" -> "Streaming Remote" to enable or configure; closing the window closes the plugin.

## Web UI

1. Download the Web UI and extract it
2. Open `index.html` in your favorite browser; Google Chrome is recommended
3. Enter the password and connection details; for example, if OBS is running on 'mypc' with WebSocket port
   9002, enter `ws://mypc:9002`. Be sure to use the WebSocket port, not the TCP port.
